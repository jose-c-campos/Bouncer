  <h1 align="left">Bouncer: iOS App to Discover/Promote Events</h1>
</span>

## About
<p>
  Bouncer is designed to be an all-in-one platform where university students can promote parties, sell tickets, verify guests on entry, and find other parties nearby. I noticed in college that this process is currently segmented across Instagram, Venmo, and Messages: Student orgs promote their events on Instagram, users then have to purchase tickets through Venmo, inform friends via text, and then pull up their Venmo transactions at the door as proof of payment. This fragmented process is cumbersome and inefficient. My app streamlines the entire process by allowing organizations to promote events directly to their target audience, providing users with a seamless experience to find and purchase tickets, and creating a secure verification system at the door.
